# Cartoonify

##### Cartoonify images using OpenCV on Python.

#### Implementation Details

This Project is built using VSCode. Initial it was meant to be created in the form of a jupyter notebook but I ran into some issues with that. So I opted to just create it as a normal python file.

I personally used venv as my virtual environment for dependency managements, although It not absolutely to do so. I've been really finding using virtual envs productive for my projects.

I have provided the requirements.txt file incase anyone want to try it out.

#### Steps to run the program

##### Using venv:
* `python3 -m venv NAME`  to create a virtual env inside the cloned repo

* `source NAME/bin/activate`  to activate the virtual env
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`  to install the required dependencies

And your are pretty much good to go!

##### Running Normally:

* Just run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command before u try to run the program.

__I dont think every package/module mentioned in the requirements.txt is absolutely neccessary to run the program. I have removed ones I'm absolutely sure the it won't need.__

There is a version of this program with a GUI that I'm working on. But it still has some errors that need to be fixed.
